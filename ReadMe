This is a web version of my project mGm (mini Google maps), using html, css and javaScript 
After the local version made using C for back-end & Python for the front-end, I tought it's time to scale up and take a step into the web dev and make the app public and free to use by the Uni students.
I am very glad with the result !!!!! Yeeeahaaw
